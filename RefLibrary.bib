	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Vascular malformations arise in vessels throughout the entire body. Causative genetic mutations have been identified for many of these diseases; however, little is known about the mutant cell lineage within these malformations.
OBJECTIVE: We utilize an inducible mouse model of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) coupled with a multicolor fluorescent reporter to visualize the contribution of mutant endothelial cells (ECs) to the malformation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We combined a Ccm3 mouse model with the confetti fluorescent reporter to simultaneously delete Ccm3 and label the mutant EC with 1 of 4 possible colors. We acquired Z-series confocal images from serial brain sections and created 3-dimensional reconstructions of entire CCMs to visualize mutant ECs during CCM development. We observed a pronounced pattern of CCMs lined with mutant ECs labeled with a single confetti color (n=42). The close 3-dimensional distribution, as determined by the nearest neighbor analysis, of the clonally dominant ECs within the CCM was statistically different than the background confetti labeling of ECs in non-CCM control brain slices as well as a computer simulation ( P<0.001). Many of the small (<100 μm diameter) CCMs consisted, almost exclusively, of the clonally dominant mutant ECs labeled with the same confetti color, whereas the large (>100 μm diameter) CCMs contained both the clonally dominant mutant cells and wild-type ECs. We propose of model of CCM development in which an EC acquires a second somatic mutation, undergoes clonal expansion to initiate CCM formation, and then incorporates neighboring wild-type ECs to increase the size of the malformation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to visualize, with single-cell resolution, the clonal expansion of mutant ECs within CCMs. The incorporation of wild-type ECs into the growing malformation presents another series of cellular events whose elucidation would enhance our understanding of CCMs and may provide novel therapeutic opportunities.},

@article{Wang:2018aa,
	Abstract = {The morphology and composition of tissue located within parietal shell canals of the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite are described. Longitudinal canal tissue nearly spans the length of side shell plates, terminating near the leading edge of the specimen basis in proximity to female reproductive tissue located throughout the peripheral sub-mantle region, i.e. mantle parenchyma. Microscopic examination of stained longitudinal canal sections reveal the presence of cell nuclei as well as an abundance of micron-sized spheroids staining positive for basic residues and lipids. Spheroids with the same staining profile are present extensively in ovarioles, particularly within oocytes which are readily identifiable at various developmental stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of longitudinal canal tissue compared to tissue collected from the mantle parenchyma reveals a nearly 50% overlap of the protein profile with the greatest number of sequence matches to vitellogenin, a glycolipoprotein playing a key role in vitellogenesis-yolk formation in developing oocytes. The morphological similarity and proximity to female reproductive tissue, combined with mass spectrometry of the two tissues, provides compelling evidence that one of several possible functions of longitudinal canal tissue is supporting the female reproductive system of A. amphitrite, thus expanding the understanding of the growth and development of this sessile marine organism.},

@article{Koskimaki:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are dilated capillaries causing epilepsy and stroke. Inheritance of a heterozygous mutation in CCM3/PDCD10 is responsible for the most aggressive familial form of the disease. Here we studied the differences and commonalities between the transcriptomes of microdissected lesional neurovascular units (NVUs) from acute and chronic in vivo Ccm3/Pdcd10ECKO mice, and cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) Ccm3/Pdcd10ECKO.We identified 2409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in acute and 2962 in chronic in vivo NVUs compared to microdissected brain capillaries, as well as 121 in in vitro BMECs with and without Ccm3/Pdcd10 loss (fold change ≥ |2.0|; p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). A functional clustered dendrogram generated using the Euclidean distance showed that the DEGs identified only in acute in vivo NVUs were clustered in cellular proliferation gene ontology functions. The DEGs only identified in chronic in vivo NVUs were clustered in inflammation and immune response, permeability, and adhesion functions. In addition, 1225 DEGs were only identified in the in vivo NVUs but not in vitro BMECs, and these clustered within neuronal and glial functions. One miRNA mmu-miR-3472a was differentially expressed (FC = - 5.98; p = 0.07, FDR corrected) in the serum of Ccm3/Pdcd10+/- when compared to wild type mice, and this was functionally related as a putative target to Cand2 (cullin associated and neddylation dissociated 2), a DEG in acute and chronic lesional NVUs and in vitro BMECs. Our results suggest that the acute model is characterized by cell proliferation, while the chronic model showed inflammatory, adhesion and permeability processes. In addition, we highlight the importance of extra-endothelial structures in CCM disease, and potential role of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease, interacting with DEGs. The extensive DEGs library of each model will serve as a validation tool for potential mechanistic, biomarker, and therapeutic targets.},

@article{Snellings:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a Mendelian disease characterized by vascular malformations (VMs) including visceral arteriovenous malformations and mucosal telangiectasia. HHT is caused by loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in one of three genes, ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and is inherited as an autosomal-dominant condition. Intriguingly, the constitutional mutation causing HHT is present throughout the body, yet the multiple VMs in individuals with HHT occur focally, rather than manifesting as a systemic vascular defect. This disconnect between genotype and phenotype suggests that a local event is necessary for the development of VMs. We investigated the hypothesis that local somatic mutations seed the formation HHT-related telangiectasia in a genetic two-hit mechanism. We identified low-frequency somatic mutations in 9/19 telangiectasia through the use of next-generation sequencing. We established phase for seven of nine samples, which confirms that the germline and somatic mutations in all seven samples exist in trans configuration; this is consistent with a genetic two-hit mechanism. These combined data suggest that bi-allelic loss of ENG or ACVRL1 may be a required event in the development of telangiectasia, and that rather than haploinsufficiency, VMs in HHT are caused by a Knudsonian two-hit mechanism.},
